    "#### **Case Study: Facility Layout Optimization using a Genetic Algorithm (Quadratic Assignment Problem)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a planning engineer for a manufacturing company that is setting up a new factory. The factory has 8 predefined locations where 8 different departments must be placed. The cost of operating the factory is heavily influenced by the material handling cost, which depends on the **flow of materials** between departments and the **distances** between the locations they are assigned to. Your task is to find the optimal assignment of departments to locations that **minimizes the total material handling cost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Problem Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **A Distance Matrix (`distance_matrix`)**: An 8x8 matrix where `distance_matrix[i][j]` is the distance between location `i` and location `j`.\n",
    "2.  **A Flow Matrix (`flow_matrix`)**: An 8x8 matrix where `flow_matrix[i][j]` is the amount of material flow from department `i` to department `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Variables (Genes):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A solution is a permutation (a sequence) of 8 unique numbers from 0 to 7. For example, the solution `[3, 0, 1, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2]` means Department 0 is assigned to Location 3, Department 1 to Location 0, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective (to be minimized):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Minimize the total cost, calculated as: $Cost = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} Flow(i, j) \\times Distance(p_i, p_j)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Programming Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Review the `GeneticAlgorithmQAP` Class**: A pre-built class for solving the QAP is provided below. It handles fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Configure and Run the GA**: In the main script section at the bottom, your task is to create an instance of the `GeneticAlgorithmQAP` class. You must provide the correct values for the following parameters:\n",
    "    * `population_size`\n",
    "    * `num_generations`\n",
    "    * `mutation_rate`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Set these to reasonable values (e.g., `population_size = 100`, `num_generations = 200`, `mutation_rate = 0.05`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Run the Notebook**: Execute all cells to run the optimization and see the final layout plot. The autograding system will evaluate the `Best Assignment Cost` printed in the output."
